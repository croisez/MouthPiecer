### About MouthPiecer

MouthPiecer is an arduino script for Teensy4.1, acting as a man-in-the-middle MIDI device.
The first goal for myself was to build a device that would add a way to insert pitch bend capabilities for my TravelSax 2 wind controller.
But, more generally, a lot more continuous controls can be added on the fly to the MIDI traffic generated by a controller, by using this method.
